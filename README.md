Digital Paper Warfare
Digital Paper Warfare is a fun, real-time, competitive strategy game where two players face off on a digitally rendered "paper battlefield." Players can draw on their side to design fortifications and deploy units before engaging in tactical combat against their opponent.

Game Overview
Drawing Phase:
In the early phase, each player can draw on their designated half of the canvas to set up their battlefield. There are specific rules—such as no drawing in restricted zones—to ensure fair play.

Combat Phase:
Once both players have finished drawing, the game transitions to active combat. Use simple controls to move your units, fire shells, and try to outmaneuver your opponent.

The game includes turn-based mechanics, with timers indicating when it's your turn to act. It's as easy as clicking to move or shoot.
