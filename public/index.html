        <h3>Welcome to Digital Paper Warfare!</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare for an epic showdown where strategy meets creativity.</strong>
          In Digital Paper Warfare, each player commands two reactors and two tanks, battling it out to dominate the
          battlefield. Your mission?
          <strong>Destroy at least one of your opponent‚Äôs reactors or both of their tanks</strong>
          to claim victory!
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Started: The Drawing Phase</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Draw Your Obstacles:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create up to five obstacles on the game board. These barriers can shape the battlefield to your
                advantage. While you don't have to use all five,
                <strong>maximizing your creativity</strong>
                is highly recommended for the best strategic edge!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ready to battle early?</strong>
                If you‚Äôve crafted your perfect defenses before reaching five shapes, simply hit
                <strong>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play!‚Äù</strong>
                to move forward.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edit Your Masterpiece:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Not satisfied with a shape?</strong>
                No worries! You can erase your most recent drawing by hitting the
                <strong>Erase</strong>
                button and try again.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rules for Drawing:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>No Nested Shapes:</strong>
                Shapes cannot be drawn inside or engulf other shapes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Overlapping:</strong>
                While your shapes can intersect with themselves, they
                <em>cannot intersect with shapes drawn by your opponent</em>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Respect the No-Drawing Zones:</strong>
                Avoid the designated areas around the fortresses and the margins around the board to prevent complete
                blockades.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ink Management:</strong>
                You have a limited amount of ink for each shape, so
                <em>draw wisely</em>
                to optimize your defenses and strategies!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time is Ticking:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The drawing phase lasts for
                <strong>60 seconds</strong>
                or until both players have either completed their five shapes or are ready to proceed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Enter the Battle Phase</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Turn-Based Combat:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The battle unfolds in
                <strong>turns</strong>
                , each lasting
                <strong>30 seconds</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>One Action per Turn:</strong>
                On your turn, choose to either
                <strong>move</strong>
                or
                <strong>shoot</strong>
                with your tanks or utilize your turret‚Äôs shooting capabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tanks vs. Turrets:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tanks:</strong>
                    Agile units that can move across the battlefield or take precise shots at your enemy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Turrets:</strong>
                    Defensive structures that can shoot but remain stationary, providing steady firepower.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heat Management:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Action Activation:</strong>
                Click on a tank or turret to perform an action. This starts the
                <strong>power thermometer</strong>
                , which gauges the heat level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Heat Dynamics:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Optimal Heat:</strong>
                    Hit the right heat level for a more powerful shot.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Overheating:</strong>
                    Excessive heat can lead to misfires, so balance your actions carefully.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Directional Control:</strong>
                Move or shoot by dragging your mouse in the opposite direction of your intended action‚Äî

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Health and Strategy:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tanks:</strong>
                Each tank has
                <strong>2 hit points</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reactors:</strong>
                Each reactor has
                <strong>1 hit point</strong>
                .
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fortresses and Obstacles:</strong>
                While fortresses are indestructible,
                <strong>tanks cannot move through shapes or fortresses</strong>
                , requiring you to strategize your movements and attacks thoughtfully.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shooting Through Walls:</strong>
                Tanks can
                <strong>shoot through fortress walls</strong>
                , allowing for strategic offensive plays even behind defenses.
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time Pressure:</strong>

              <li>
                <strong>Fast-Paced Turns:</strong>
                Each turn is
                <strong>30 seconds</strong>
                , demanding quick and decisive actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ticking Clock Penalty:</strong>
                Fail to make a move within the allotted time, and your next turn will be
                <strong>only 3 seconds long</strong>
                until you perform a valid action again.
                <em>Stay sharp and keep the pressure on!</em>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
